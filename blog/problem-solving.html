        Problem Solving
      </h1>
      <h2 class="paragraph-large">
        1. were blocked on a simple problem:
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph-medium">
        <strong>what was the problem?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I was trying to split() a string into an array, and I used '' (empty quotes) instead of ' ' (empty space).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-medium">
        <strong>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I looked up solutions in stack overflow and also checked the MDN.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-medium">
        <strong>how did you feel throughout the process?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Pretty annoyed till I found the solution. Pretty relaxed afterwards.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-medium">
        <strong>what did you learn?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        I learned that it is better to take a break sometimes and approach the problem later with a fresh mind.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="paragraph-large">
        2. elegantly solved a problem.
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph-medium">
        <strong>what was the problem?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Solved the fizzbuzz and super fizzbuzz challenge without any hiccups.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-medium">
        <strong>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Wrote down the pseudo code first and then implemented the solution step by step.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-medium">
        <strong>how did you feel throughout the process?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Pretty awesome.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-medium">
        <strong>what did you learn?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Breaking down the problem in step by step in a non-proramming language can be pretty helpful to visualize the solution.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="paragraph-large">
        3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:

      <p class="paragraph-medium">
        <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Confident. But I need to do it more often.

      <p class="paragraph-medium">
        <strong>Trying something</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Pretty confident.

      <p class="paragraph-medium">
        <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Haven’t done it yet. But I might do it in the future if I get completely stuck.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-medium">
        <strong>Reading error messages</strong>

      <p class="paragraph">

      <br>
      <h2 class="paragraph-large">
        4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.
      </h2>
      
      <p class="paragraph">
        I got stuck sometimes during the katas. But I was still confident that I would be able to find the solution. So, I didn't want to ask for help until I was completely lost.
