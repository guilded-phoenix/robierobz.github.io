      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>Neuroplasty</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Knowing the principles of neuroplasticity can have many benefits for people, such as aiding in rehabilitation after injuries, improving learning and skill acquisition, promoting mental health, and combating cognitive decline. By understanding how the brain adapts and changes, individuals can take steps to improve their brain health and well-being throughout their lives.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Personally, Neuroplasty can be used to improve my learning abilities and improve my mental health. It is empowering to know that I have control over my learning abilities and how my brain functions. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">There are several ways to boost your brain's ability to adapt and change throughout your life. These include learning new skills, exercising regularly, practicing mindfulness and meditation, getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in mentally stimulating activities. By adopting a healthy lifestyle and challenging your brain regularly, you can promote brain health and increase your neuroplasticity.

      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>Growth Mindset</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Growth mindset refers to the idea that intelligence and abilities can be improved through effort, hard work, and learning. People with a growth mindset see challenges and failures as opportunities to learn and develop, rather than as a reflection of their limitations. In contrast, a fixed mindset is the belief that abilities are static and unchangeable. Psychologist Carol Dweck introduced the concept of growth mindset, which has been linked to higher levels of success and achievement in various fields, such as education, sports, and business.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Personally, I would change my mindset about the obstacles I face. I wonâ€™t see them as demotivating anymore. Instead, I would see it as an opportunity to train my brain.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>Learning plan and strategies</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">I would continue doing meditation, and manage a healthy lifestyle to keep my mind and body healthy. I would start doing JavaScript challenges daily to improve my coding skills.</p>
