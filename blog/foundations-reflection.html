      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>1. What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">I realised I am hesitant in asking for support when Iâ€™m stuck. I tend to keep the assignments till the beginning of the weekend and do them all in a single stretch. I am more productive when there is pressure.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>2. What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">It is important to realise that we all have bad moments in life and it is important to support one another. Need to empathise with the struggles of the other person to develop better bonds as a team.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>3. What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Neuroplasticity. I always thought we are all born with predetermined way of thinking and problem solving abilities. It was surprising and empowering to know that I have a certain level of control over my abilities.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>4. What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Identifying and working out what I want to study and how I would tackle it. And also coming up with plans to take care of my physical and mental health.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">It is important to have the right mindset, and the right set of human skills to work in the tech world.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>6. Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">No. Nothing is a waste of time. There is no point in shutting down the mind to something I am not familiar with. Practicing programming is great, but that comes as default in a web development bootcamp. Was interesting to learn about the things I came across in the core learning.</p>
