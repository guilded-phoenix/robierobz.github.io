      <p class="paragraph">Ideally, I would like to get into front-end development, focusing on React. In the long term, I want to become a fullstack developer.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">When things are building up and starting to get to me, I wouldn't hesitate to ask for my colleague's feedback if they have suggestions on improving my workflow.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">I would list out the tasks based on the order of priority and tackle them one by one in a timely fashion. </p>
