    <h2 class="heading-2" id="week-1">Week 1 - Reflect on your personal and professional growth while demonstrating the ability to show self compassion</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>1. What went well?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Was nice to meet everyone in-person. Finished all the challenges in time and submitted the trello tickets.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>2. What have you learnt about how you learn best so far?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Pair programming makes everything easy. When I get stuck, the other person would immediately notice the issue. Good to see the diofferent perspectives. But at the same time, I need to make sure I can do these challenges by myself when I am doing coding alone.</p>
      
      <br><br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>3. What learning didn't go so well for you and why?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">I should have spent more time on revision during the weekends.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>4. What would you change?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Would spend more time practicing everything.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-2" id="week-1">Week 1 - Demonstrate the ability to create & contribute to a supportive and inclusive team culture</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>1. What did you learn about Empathy and Trust in this weeks Deep Dive?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Empathy - It's okay to not know what to say, but make sure you are there for people as someone who listens to their problems, instead of forcing them to see the silver lining on their misery.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Trust - Respect the boundaries of toher people and at the same time, be clear about your own boundaries. Be reliable. Own your mistakes. Guar the secrets entrusted to you. Choose courage over comfort. Ask for help without feeling hesitation. Help others whenever you can.</p>
      
      <br><br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>2. How could these values support you to create a strong team culture?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">I can become the person others can entrust their feeling and emotions with.</p>
      
      <br><br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>3. If you are upset, how do you want to be shown empathy?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Just hoping the other person to listen to me patiently instead of blaming me.</p>
      
      <br><br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>4. How can you use listening and looping to show empathy to others?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">It can help in opening up about the challenges and feelings when they work with me.</p>
      
      <br><br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>5. How have you practised showing empathy (e.g. through listening and looping) this week?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Listened to how the other person's experience was while pair programming with me. Heard the ;positive and negatives. Will focus on improving.</p>
