      <h1 class="heading-1">Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">I will come back to this later. I would like to think about it for some time.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Coming out of my country has forced me to broaden my views and I am forever thankful to NZ for that. The kind, warm, friendly nature of the people in NZ has influenced me 
        a lot for the better in both my personal and professional life. When it comes to the values I learnt from my family, I learnt not to give up on things easily when life gets hard.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">I am persistent and have a can-do attitude. I always lend a helping hand whenever I can and this has helped me become a team player. I also try to empathise with the other person
        and try to see their perspective. I hope all these strength will prove valuable in my learning journey in making good friends and learning new things.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph"> Losing the initial spark of interest over time has been the bane of my career growth. I am hoping this bootcamp would help me stay motivated throughout the journey.

      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="paragraph-large"> <strong>5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">Back in my uni days, I used to work for a fastfood restaurant. Whenever my manager called me because someone else couldn't show up for work, I 
        always said yes, just so that the work would go forward smoothly. I would cover for sick people and people with family emergencies, and this improved the 
        overall team morale.
